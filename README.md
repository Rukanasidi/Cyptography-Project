# 🔁 Data Structures and Recursion in C++

This project consists of two parts implemented in **C++**:

1. **Custom Singly Linked List**
2. **Recursive Problem Solving**

Each section focuses on fundamental programming concepts such as pointers, memory management, recursion, and algorithm design.

## 📌 Project Objectives

### Question 1: Custom Singly Linked List

Implement a singly linked list with the following features:
- Add a node at the beginning, middle, and end of the list
- Delete a node by value or position
- Display all nodes in the list
- Handle edge cases (e.g. deleting from an empty list)
- Test the implementation with at least 3 sets of input data

### Question 2: Recursive Functions

Implement the following problems using recursion:
- **Factorial Calculation**: Compute the factorial of a number
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Generate the first `n` Fibonacci numbers
- **String Reversal**: Reverse a string recursively
- **Binary Search**: Find a target value in a sorted array recursively

Each recursive function includes:
- A clear **base case** and **recursive case**
- Testing with at least 3 inputs, including edge cases

## 🧠 Features

### ✅ Linked List
- Insert at head, middle, and tail
- Delete by value or index
- Traverse and display list
- Error handling (e.g. empty list deletion)

### 🔁 Recursion
- Factorial function
- Fibonacci sequence generator
- String reversal
- Recursive binary search
